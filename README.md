# fuzzy-examples

Some of the examples out of the [*Fuzzy Data Matching with SQL*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fuzzy-data-matching/9781098152260/) book from O'Reilly Media.

The *Setup* directory contains DDL to create the necessary schemas and tables and populate the tables with the data used in the book. They should work as-is on
most RDBMSes, but were generated using SQL Server Management Studio.
